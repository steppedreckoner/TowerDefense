NOT A FINISHED PRODUCT - STILL IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT

Note: If features aren't working as described, check the commit messages as they might be more current 
than this readme.

This project aims to both demonstrate and expand my programming ability. I initially began development 
in conjunction with a tutorial (found at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0MHs87ehhLOtPQf_bAWDEA), but
I have since diverged, including the following.

-Pathfinder class to handle enemy navigation. This will eventually allow for enemies to navigate around
 player placed obstacles.
-Start and end tiles determined on loading map, no longer have to be hardcoded.
-Navigation done with Dijkstra's algorithm. Allows for reliable navigation of maps with 
 tracks wider than 1 tile.
-Reworked the game map to be static.
-Enums for easier selection of enemies and projectiles.


Instructions:

PLAY: Begins a new game. Enemy type cannot currently be changed. Place towers with "T". You can change what
get placed by pressing 1, 2 or 3. Towers can be deleted with 80% refund by hovering over a tower and pressing
"D".

EDITOR: Loads a map with all grass tiles. Tile type can be modifed by clicking on a tile. Switch the type
that clicking changes to by pressing the right arrow key (default is grass, so initially clicking will
look like it's doing nothing). Save and Load features (S and L) are currently buggy, and probably won't work.

QUIT: Quits.


To Do:

-Improved saving and loading. Play button loads a map from a file, and new maps can be loaded after 
beginning a game. 

-Tower selection menu and tower placement with mouse.

-More tower and projectile types, with unlock progression.

-Level up of towers.

-One tower can shoot multiple types of projectiles. Perhaps "special shots" will be unlocked at a 
 certain level.

-(DONE) Towers can be removed by player, probably with partial refund.

-(PARTIAL) More enemy types with level progression for the same enemy type.

-Lives and money displayed on-screen.

-(DONE) Losing all lives causes a game over screen with an option to reset.

-Balancing
